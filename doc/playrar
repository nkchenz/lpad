Require
--------
unrar

DataFormat
-----------
uncompressing to: /dev/shm/lpad

file path format: /dev/shm/lpad/$real-path-of-rarfile/*.[mp3,ape,flac]

rar might has directories, does not contain music files directly, need a
special marker like this to hide and carry the real path:

    /dev/shm/lpad/$real-path-of-rarfile.lpad-marker/*.[mp3,ape,flac]

Playlist Format
----------------
Need to be changed, should contains meta and track infos of ape, and flac, 
so we don't need to read cue files while loading playlist, which is not 
possible if we do lazy uncompressing.

Play
-----
These audio files in rar are stored in playlist just as ordinary files. The
magic is to check the file path before playing it.

If it starts with '/dev/shm/lpad', we know it's in some compressed rars, do:

    if path does't exist:
        get real path of the rar file
        uncompressing it to dirname(path)

    play as usual

Add
-----
lazy uncompressing. Don't extract files when loading playlist.

add_file:

    If f starts with '/dev/shm/lpad':
        r = get rar path of f
        if r does't exist:
            do nothing
            return
        add f blindly # No need to check whether f exists. Because if we are
        loading playlist, f might possiblly not exist, and we don't want to
        extract it right now. And if we are adding a rar file, f certainly exists. 
        
        In either case, we really don't care. 
        
        Only when playing, should we do some uncompressing job.

    if ext is .rar:
        uncompressing
        add path as usual

Problems
--------
If there are too many uncompressed files, we might run short of memory

Check mem usage, threshold 3/4
