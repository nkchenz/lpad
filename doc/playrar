Require
--------
unrar

DataFormat
-----------
uncompressing to: /dev/shm/lpad

file path format: /dev/shm/lpad/$real-path-of-rarfile/*.[mp3,ape,flac]

Play
-----
These audio files in rar are stored in playlist just as ordinary files. The
magic is to check the file path before playing it.

If it starts with '/dev/shm/lpad', we know it's in some compressed rars, do:

    if path does't exist:
        get real path of the rar file
        uncompressing it to dirname(path)

    play as usual

Add
-----
When draged or added, do
    path = '/dev/shm/lpad/' + $real-path-of-rarfile
    if path does't exist:
        uncompressing 
    add path as usual

Problems
--------
If there are too many uncompressed files, we might run short of memory

keep tracking /dev/shm/lpad size?
keep tracking uncompressed file number?
LRU?
